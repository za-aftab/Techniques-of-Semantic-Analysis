Fig Pudding 

Ingredients: 1lb. bread crumbs, 1 teacupful sugar, ½lb. figs, 2 eggs, 2 or 4ozs. butter. Put crumbs into a basin, melt butter and mix, add figs, cut in small pieces, beat eggs and mix all together with a spoon, add milk or water, and mix to the consistency of a thick batter; steam in a basin in the usual way three hours. Lemon rind grated is a great improvement. Eggs may be omitted if desired.

Miscellaneous 

Treacle Ale 

Pour two quarts of boiling water on a pound of treacle, and stir them together. Add six quarts of cold water and a teacupful of yeast. Tun it into a cask, cover it close down, and it will be fit to drink in two or three days. If made in large quantities or intended to keep, put in a handful of malt and hops, and when the fermentation is over, stop it up close. 

Foamy Sauce 

Beat the yolks of two eggs and one cupful of powdered sugar well together, set the bowl into boiling water, and stir until quite hot, then add the whites (beaten stiff), add a small piece of butter and a tablespoon of brandy or extract after taking from the stove, and serve immediately. 

Preserved Egg Plums 

Four pounds of fine egg plums, with their stems; four pounds of loaf sugar. Wash the plums in cold water and wipe dry carefully. Put the sugar on a slow fire in the preserving kettle, with as much water as will wet the sugar, and let it simmer slowly; then prick each thoroughly with a needle, and place a layer of them in the syrup; let them cook until they lose their colour a little and the skins begin to break, then lift them out with a perforated skimmer, and place them singly in a large dish to cool. Then put another layer of plums into the syrup and let them simmer and cool in the same manner until the whole are done. As they cool, carefully replace the broken skins, so as not to destroy the appearance of the plums. When the last layer is finished return the first to the kettle and boil until transparent. Do the same with each layer. While the latest cooked are cooling place the first in the glass jars; when all are done pour the hot syrup over them, and when cold close as usual. The jelly should be of the colour and consistence of rich wine jelly. 

Preserved Pears 

To every pound of sugar allow half-pint of water. Procure some jargonelle pears (not too ripe), put them into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and simmer them till rather tender, but do not allow them to break; then put them in cold water. Boil the sugar and water together for five minutes. Repeat the simmering for three successive days, taking care not to let the fruit break. The last time of boiling for ten minutes. When the pears are done drain them from the syrup, and dry them in the sun, or in a cool oven; or they may be kept in the syrup, and dried as they are wanted. half-an-hour should be allowed for simmering the pears in water, and twenty minutes in the syrup. 

Cheap Ices 

To a quart of best new milk put four or six fresh eggs, according to size, half a pound of loaf-sugar, broken small or powdered, and one ounce of fresh butter; whisk all together, and place the pan on a moderate fire, keeping the whole well stirred from the bottom till it nearly boils, but not quite, or it will curdle – this must be watched – and, when it becomes thick, immediately take the pan off, and then strain through a hair-sieve. This ice can be flavoured according to taste, but essence of vanilla is mostly used. It can be also coloured with extract of cochineal, and flavoured with the fruit or essence of raspberry cream. Note: The above is an example for whatever quantity may be required. 

No. 2. – Instead of using so many eggs to the quart of milk, as in the above recipe, use half the number, and no butter, with half an ounce of prepared gelatine, and the same quantity of sugar; proceed exactly according to the above directions. the gelatine quickly dissolves in the mixture, and makes a smoother ice. this is preferred by most people, though there is not the same amount of nourishment in it. 

Note: all mixtures should be cold when used for freezing. 

Lemon Doughnuts 

Ingredients: Quarter pound butter, 14 ounces fine pastry flour, three ounces castor sugar, the grated rind and juice of one good-sized lemon, one ounce lemon candied peel (or not, according to taste). Method: Sift the flour into a basin, rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, add the sugar and lemon rind, shred the candied peel finely and add; beat up the yolks of the eggs with the lemon juice; whisk the white of eggs to a fine froth, and pour both into a hole made in the centre of the flour, &c. Mix well with the hand to a light smooth but stiff batter, divide (with floured fingers) into small pieces, form into marbles about one inch in diameter, then immerse to half their depth in boiling fat; when a good brown on one side turn over and fry on the other. Drain on cooking paper laid on a sieve in front of the fire, shower with castor sugar, and serve at once or leave until cold. 

Rhubarb Jelly 

Soak two ounces of gelatine in a pint of water with half a pound of best lump sugar; well wash and slice about two pounds and a half of rhubarb of a nice bright colour, put it into a stewpan to boil with a quart of water, leave it to get thoroughly stewed, but not long enough to let the juice get thick; strain the latter, and add a pint and a half of it to the dissolved gelatine, with the whites and shells of three eggs. Whisk it all quickly on the fire, pass it through the jelly-bag, and pour it into a mould and leave it to set. 

Puff Paste 

Half a lb. of flour, ½ lb. of butter. Rub a bit of butter the size of a walnut into the flour, dry, mix the flour into a light paste with a little cold water, mixing a few drops of lemon [available from the 17th century] juice with the water; flatten the rest of the butter into a wet cloth. Take the paste, pull it out with your hand the size of a plate, and lay the butter in it; fold the paste over it, and leave for ten minutes, beat well, roll out thin, and fold in six folds; repeat this tree times, waiting ten minutes between each. it is then ready for use. Good, fresh lard can be used instead of butter. 

Corn-Meal Gems 

Two cups corn-meal (Indian meal), one cup flour, two eggs beaten light, two cups sweet milk, one tablespoonful baking soda, and two teaspoonfuls cream of tartar. Beat your eggs very light, add the milk; have ready mixed together the corn-meal flour, cream of tartar, and sugar. Pour in your mixed eggs and milk, then your butter, melted, and lastly, the soda dissolved in a tablespoonful of boiling water. Stir vigorously together for a minute, then put into little gem pans (patty-pans) and pop into a very brisk oven.

A note about kitchen measurements:
Not all tablespoons are the same. The Australian tablespoon is 20 ml; the British tablespoon is 17.7 ml. In most Canadian recipes, the tablespoon is 15 ml., while the American tablespoon is 14.2 ml.
In British, Australian and sometimes Canadian recipes, the “imperial pint”  is used which is 20 fluid ounces. American and sometimes Canadian recipes use the American pint of 16 fluid ounces.

Note: Since the volume measurement of an ingredient depends on how you pack the measuring cup/spoon and on the ingredient itself (how it is cut, its density, its water content), the volume-to-weight conversions are not absolute: they are simply a reflection of my own experience.

Hi – really appreciate all of this info, but as always, I do get slightly confused. Is the following on a different volume measurement, or is there something I missed?

Liquid (Fluid or Volume) Measurements (approximate):
The second table says that 1 cup = 237 mL

The 5th table says:

Volume (Liquid)
1 cup = 250 mL

Please help! Thanks 🙂

Hello M k
Not all measuring cups are the same
American cups are 237ml
While a metric cup is 250 ml

The cups I use in my recipes are 250 ml
I hope this helps

Hi there,
I only just came across your conversion chart which is totally awesome! I live in Nova Scotia Canada and am used to our general measurements-cups, teaspoons and ounces. I’m an ‘Ole school’ kinda girl who is presently somewhat confused. The recipe I’m trying to make is a Carrot Cake which calls for 1.5c of flour plus 1.5 teaspoon baking soda. Would you possibly know the conversion for this into (my) regular cups or teaspoons method so I can continue on with you baking? Thank you so very kindly 🙂

My dear Sawsan.
I spent my early life growing-up during the 50’s in Aqaba, Jordan. I returned to England for school, when 12 years old.
My Sister and myself were virtually brought-up by our, house servant’s family. Indeed we spent more time amongst his family than our own, such wonderful people. So loving and caring.
We became such a part of that family, our own Mother never needed to worry about us.
The grandparents were the best.!
They spoilt all of the kids so much, my sister and I, as much as their blood children.
Happy Days.
The flavours of that time are so ingrained in me, I have tried to replicate them so often but, alas to no avail. That is until, I discovered your website.
So many other sites blind us with complicated procedures and hard to obtain ingredients.
Your recipes are so simple and basic.
They are the pure essence of every-day food that is found in the “Middle East”.
Wonderful….
I thank you so much.
S.

10	Tablespoons	butter
1 1/2	cups	granulated sugar
3		eggs, separated, whites beaten until stiff
1	cup	buttermilk*
1 1/2	ounces	(1 1/2 squares ) unsweetened chocolate, melted
1 1/4	teaspoons	vanilla extract
1	teaspoon	almond extract
Filling:
2 1/2	cups	evaporated milk
2	ounces	(2 squares) semi-sweet chocolate
1 1/4	cups	granulated sugar
5	Tablespoons	flour
4		egg yolks
2	Tablespoons	butter
1 1/4	teaspoons	vanilla extract
1/4	teaspoon	almond extract
Frosting:
1 1/4	cups	granulated sugar
1	cup	evaporated milk
1 1/2	ounces	(1 1/2 squares) unsweetened chocolate
4	Tablespoons	butter
1	teaspoon	vanilla extract
Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Grease and flour 2 nine-inch round cake pans.

Cake Preparation:
In a medium bowl, combine cake flour, soda and salt; set aside.

Cream the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl, and add egg yolks, one at a time. Gradually alternate adding the flour mixture and buttermilk. Add the melted chocolate and beat for 2 minutes.

Fold in the 3 beaten egg whites, vanilla and almond extract. Bake for 45 minutes or until done. After the cake cools, slice each layer in half horizontally to make 4 thin layers.

Filling Preparation:
Combine evaporated milk and chocolate in a saucepan and heat until chocolate is melted. In a medium bowl, combine sugar and flour. Make a paste by adding hot milk chocolate one tablespoon at a time to the sugar and flour, then return to saucepan. Stir over medium heat until thick. Add 4 egg yolks all at once and stir rapidly to completely blend. Cook 2 or 3 minutes more. Remove from heat, and add butter, vanilla extract and almond extract. Cool.

Place first layer on plate or cake stand and spread 1/3 of the filling over top, repeat for second and third layers so no filling remains. Add fourth layer.

Frosting preparation:
Combine sugar and evaporated milk in a heavy saucepan, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer for 6 minutes without stirring. Remove from heat and blend in chocolate. Add margarine and vanilla extract and return to medium-low heat, cooking 1 or 2 minutes. Place in refrigerator to cool. Beat well, then spread on top and the sides of the cake.


*No buttermilk? Substitute 1 tablespoon lemon juice and enough milk to make 1 cup.

Please note that some ingredients and brands may not be available in every store.

Recipe from Yesterday

From “The Henry Ford Organization” 1814 recipes

To stuff and roast a Turkey or Fowl:

One pound soft wheat bread, three ounces beef suet, three eggs, a little sweet thyme, marjoram, pepper and salt, and some add a gill of wine; fill the bird with this and sew up. Hang down to a steady solid fire, basting frequently with butter and water. Roast until a steam emits from the breast, put one third of a pound of butter into the gravy, dust flour over the bird and baste with the gravy; serve up with boiled onions and cranberry sauce, mangoes, pickles or celery.

Some omit the sweet herbs, and add parsley done with potatoes: Boil and mash three pints of potatoes; moisten them with butter, add sweet herbs, pepper, salt, fill and roast as above.

Baking Advice from Yesterday

 Advice for baking sponge or pound cake: The oven should be hot enough to turn a piece of white paper a rich yellow in 5 minutes. For cookies, layer cakes or cupcakes, the paper should turn a dark brown in 5 minutes. For baking bread, throw a little flour on the bottom of the oven and if it browns quickly without taking fire the heat is sufficient. For baking puff paste, the heat should be greatest first and decrease later. This [is] to keep the paste in shape. When the oven is too hot the temperature may be reduced by placing a pan of cold water in it. (From PioneerCooking.com)

Pennyroyal was used as an insect repellent since pioneer days and beyond. They planted it around the foundation of the home and in window boxes to keep rats, roaches, and flying insects away.

Most homes in the Victorian era had a scullery. This was a room that held a 'copper', a metal container for washing clothes. The copper was filled with water and soap powder was added. To wash the clothes they were turned with a wooden tool called a dolly. (A dolly looked like a long wooden pole with a stool with several legs on its end). wet clothes were wrung through a device called a wringer or a mangle to dry them. The clothes wringer or mangle was invented by Robert Tasker in 1850. The 'modern' clothes peg with a spring clamp was invented by David M Smith in 1853.

 To store meat:

Cover the meat with sour milk or buttermilk and store in a cellar.
In areas where the nights are cool, hang the meat in the open from a tree so any breeze can pass around it. Make sure the meat is brought inside at dawn. During the day, wrap the meat in a tarp and store in a shady place. Make sure the blowflies don’t deposit eggs on the meat.
Keep the meat away from rain and damp nights. Any meat that gets wet must be cooked or jerked immediately.

COOKERY RECIPES
Ale to Mull.—Take a pint of good strong ale, and pour it into a saucepan with three cloves and a little nutmeg; sugar to your taste. Set it over the fire, and when it boils take it off to cool. Beat up the yolks of four eggs exceedingly well; mix them first with a little cold ale, then add them to the warm ale, and pour it in and out of the pan several times. Set it over a slow fire, beat it a little, take it off again; do this three times until it is hot, then serve it with dry toast.

Ale, Spiced.—Is made hot, sweetened with sugar and spiced with grated nutmeg, and a hot toast is served in it. This is the wassail drink.

Beef Tea.—Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin slices; simmer with a quart of water twenty minutes, after it has once boiled and been skimmed. Season if approved.

Beef Tea.—To one pound of lean beef add one and one-half tumblers of cold water; cut the beef in small pieces, cover, and let it boil slowly for ten minutes, and add a little salt after it is boiled. Excellent.

Beef Tea.—Cut lean, tender beef into small pieces, put them into a bottle, cork and set in a pot of cold water, then put on the stove and boil for one hour. Season to taste.

Black Currant Cordial.—To every four quarts of black currants, picked from the stems and lightly bruised, add one gallon of the best whisky; let it remain four months, shaking the jar occasionally, then drain off the liquor and strain. Add three pounds of loaf sugar and a quarter of a pound of best cloves, slightly bruised; bottle well and seal.

Boston Cream (a Summer Drink).—Make a syrup of four pounds of white sugar with four quarts of water; boil; when cold add four ounces of tartaric acid, one and a half ounces of essence of lemon, and the whites of six eggs beaten to a stiff froth; bottle. A wine-glass of the cream to a tumbler of water, with sufficient carbonate of soda to make it effervesce.

Champagne Cup.—One quart bottle of champagne, two bottles of soda-water, one liqueur-glass of brandy, two tablespoons of powdered sugar, a few thin strips of cucumber rind; make this just in time for use, and add a large piece of ice.

Chocolate.—Scrape Cadbury's chocolate fine, mix with a little cold water and the yolks of eggs well beaten; add this to equal parts of milk and water, and boil well, being careful that it does not burn. Sweeten to the taste, and serve hot.

Coffee.—Is a tonic and stimulating beverage, of a wholesome nature. Use the best. For eight cups use nearly eight cups of water; put in coffee as much as you like, boil a minute and take off, and throw in a cup of cold water to throw the grounds to the bottom; in five minutes it will be very clear.

Or, beat one or two eggs, which mix with ground coffee to form a ball; nearly fill the pot with cold water, simmer gently for half an hour, having introduced the ball; do not boil, or you will destroy the aroma.

Coffee.—The following is a delicious dish either for summer breakfast or dessert: Make a strong infusion of Mocha coffee; put it in a porcelain bowl, sugar it properly and add to it an equal portion of boiled milk, or one-third the quantity of rich cream. Surround the bowl with pounded ice.

Currant Wine.—One quart currant juice, three pounds of sugar, sufficient water to make a gallon.

Egg Gruel.—Boil eggs from one to three hours until hard enough to grate; then boil new milk and thicken with the egg, and add a little salt. Excellent in case of nausea.

Lemon Syrup.—Pare off the yellow rind of the lemon, slice the lemon and put a layer of lemon and a thick layer of sugar in a deep plate; cover close with a saucer, and set in a warm place. This is an excellent remedy for a cold.

Lemonade.—Take a quart of boiling water, and add to it five ounces of lump-sugar, the yellow rind of the lemon rubbed off with a bit of sugar, and the juice of three lemons. Stir all together and let it stand till cool. Two ounces of cream of tartar may be used instead of the lemons, water being poured upon it.

Raspberry Vinegar.—Fill a jar with red raspberries picked from the stalks. Pour in as much vinegar as it will hold. Let it stand ten days, then strain it through a sieve. Don't press the berries, just let the juice run through. To every pint add one pound loaf sugar. Boil it like other syrup; skim, and bottle when cold.

Summer Drink.—Boil together for five minutes two ounces of tartaric acid, two pounds white sugar, three lemons sliced, two quarts of water; when nearly cold add the whites of four eggs beaten to a froth, one tablespoonful of flour and half an ounce of wintergreen. Two tablespoonfuls in a glass of water make a pleasant drink; for those who like effervescence add as much soda as a ten-cent piece will hold, stirring it briskly before drinking.

Blackberry Syrup.—To one pint of juice put one pound of white sugar, one-half ounce of powdered cinnamon, one-fourth ounce mace, and two teaspoons cloves; boil all together for a quarter of an hour, then strain the syrup, and add to each pint a glass of French brandy.

Tea.—When the water in the teakettle begins to boil, have ready a tin tea-steeper; pour into the tea-steeper just a very little of the boiling water, and then put in tea, allowing one teaspoon of tea to each person. Pour over this boiling water until the steeper is a little more than half full; cover tightly and let it stand where it will keep hot, but not to boil. Let the tea infuse for ten or fifteen minutes, and then pour into the tea-urn, adding more boiling water, in the proportion of one cup of water for every teaspoon of dry tea which has been infused. Have boiling water in a water-pot, and weaken each cup of tea as desired. Do not use water for tea that has been boiled long. Spring water is best for tea, and filtered water next best.

Iced Tea a la Russe.—To each glass of tea add the juice of half a lemon, fill up the glass with pounded ice, and sweeten.

General Directions for Making Bread.—In the composition of good bread, there are three important requisites: Good flour, good yeast, [and here let us recommend Gillett's Magic Yeast Cakes. They keep good for one year in any climate, and once used you will not do without it. All grocers keep it] and strength to knead it well. Flour should be white and dry, crumbling easily again after it is pressed in the hand.

A very good method of ascertaining the quality of yeast will be to add a little flour to a very small quantity, setting it in a warm place. If in the course of ten or fifteen minutes it raises, it will do to use.

When you make bread, first set the sponge with warm milk or water, keeping it in a warm place until quite light. Then mold this sponge, by adding flour, into one large loaf, kneading it well. Set this to rise again, and then when sufficiently light mold it into smaller loaves, let it rise again, then bake. Care should be taken not to get the dough too stiff with flour; it should be as soft as it can be to knead well. To make bread or biscuits a nice color, wet the dough over top with water just before putting it into the oven. Flour should always be sifted.

Brown Bread, for those who can eat corn-meal: Two cups Indian meal to one cup flour; one-half teacup syrup, 2-1/2 cups milk; 1 teaspoon salt; 3 teaspoons of Gillett's baking powder. Steam an hour and a half. To be eaten hot. It goes very nicely with a corn-beef dinner.

Brown Bread.—Stir together wheat meal and cold water (nothing else, not even salt) to the consistency of a thick batter. Bake in small circular pans, from three to three and a half inches in diameter, (ordinary tin pattypans do very well) in a quick, hot oven. It is quite essential that it be baked in this sized cake, as it is upon this that the raising depends. [In this article there are none of the injurious qualities of either fermented or superfine flour bread; and it is so palpably wholesome food, that it appeals at once to the common sense of all who are interested in the subject.]

Brown Bread—Take part of the sponge that has been prepared for your white bread, warm water can be added, mix it with graham flour (not too stiff).

Boston Brown Bread.—To make one loaf:—Rye meal unsifted, half a pint; Indian meal sifted, one pint; sour milk, one pint; molasses, half a gill. Add a teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little hot water; stir well, put in a greased pan, let it rise one hour, and steam four hours.

Boston Brown Bread.—One and one-half cups of graham flour, two cups of corn meal, one-half cup of molasses, one pint of sweet milk, and one-half a teaspoon of soda; steam three hours.

Corn Bread.—One-half pint of buttermilk, one-half pint of sweet milk; sweeten the sour milk with one-half teaspoon of soda; beat two eggs, whites and yolks together; pour the milk into the eggs, then thicken with about nine tablespoons of sifted corn meal. Put the pan on the stove with a piece of lard the size of an egg; when melted pour it in the batter; this lard by stirring it will grease the pan to bake in; add a teaspoon of salt.

Excellent Bread.—Four potatoes mashed fine, four teaspoons of salt, two quarts of lukewarm milk, one-half cake Gillett's magic yeast dissolved in one-half cup of warm water, flour enough to make a pliable dough; mold with hands well greased with lard; place in pans, and when sufficiently light, it is ready for baking.

French Bread.—With a quarter of a peck of fine flour mix the yolks of three and whites of two eggs, beaten and strained, a little salt, half a pint of good yeast that is not bitter, and as much milk, made a little warm, as will work into a thin light dough. Stir it about, but don't knead it. Have ready three quart wooden dishes, divide the dough among them, set to rise, then turn them out into the oven, which must be quick. Rasp when done.

Graham Bread.—For one loaf, take two cups of white bread sponge, to which add two tablespoons of brown sugar, and graham flour to make a stiff batter; let it rise, after which add graham flour sufficient to knead, but not very stiff; then put it in the pan to rise and bake.

Italian Bread.—Make a stiff dough, with two pounds of fine flour, six of white powdered sugar, three or four eggs, a lemon-peel grated, and two ounces of fresh butter. If the dough is not firm enough, add more flour and sugar. Then turn it out, and work it well with the hand, cut it into round long biscuits, and glaze them with white of egg.

Rice and Wheat Bread.—Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts of water till soft; when it is of a proper warmth, mix it well with four pounds of flour, and yeast, and salt as for other bread; of yeast about four large spoonfuls; knead it well; then set to rise before the fire. Some of the flour should be reserved to make up the loaves. If the rice should require more water, it must be added, as some rice swells more than others.

Sago Bread.—Boil two lbs. of sago in three pints of water until reduced to a quart, then mix with it half a pint of yeast, and pour the mixture into fourteen lbs. of flour. Make into bread in the usual way.

Steamed Bread.—Two cups corn meal; 1 cup graham flour; 1/2 cup N. O. molasses; salt and teaspoonful of soda. Mix soft with sour milk, or make with sweet milk and Gillett's baking powder. Put in tight mold in kettle of water; steam three hours or more. This is as nice as Boston brown bread.

Suggestions in Making Cake.—It is very desirable that the materials be of the finest quality. Sweet, fresh butter, eggs, and good flour are the first essentials. The process of putting together is also quite an important feature, and where other methods are not given in this work by contributors, it would be well for the young housekeeper to observe the following directions:

Never allow the butter to oil, but soften it by putting in a moderately warm place before you commence other preparations for your cake; then put it into an earthen dish—tin, if not new, will discolor your cake as you stir it—and add your sugar; beat the butter and sugar to a cream, add the yolks of the eggs, then the milk, and lastly the beaten whites of the eggs and flour. Spices and liquors may be added after the yolks of the eggs are put in, and fruit should be put in with the flour.

The oven should be pretty hot for small cakes, and moderate for larger. To ascertain if a large cake is sufficiently baked, pierce it with a broom-straw through the center; if done, the straw will come out free from dough; if not done, dough will adhere to the straw. Take it out of the tin about fifteen minutes after it is taken from the oven (not sooner), and do not turn it over on the top to cool.

Frosting.—One pint granulated sugar, moisten thoroughly with water sufficient to dissolve it when heated; let it boil until it threads from the spoon, stirring often; while the sugar is boiling, beat the whites of two eggs till they are firm; then when thoroughly beaten, turn them into a deep dish, and when the sugar is boiled, turn it over the whites, beating all rapidly together until of the right consistency to spread over the cake. Flavor with lemon, if preferred. This is sufficient for two loaves.

Frosting, for Cake.—One cup frosting-sugar, two tablespoons of water boiled together; take it off the stove, and stir in the white of one egg beaten to a stiff froth; stir all together well, then frost your cake with it, and you will never want a nicer frosting than this.

Chocolate Frosting.—Whites of two eggs, one and one-half cups of fine sugar, six great spoons of grated chocolate, two teaspoons of vanilla; spread rather thickly between layers and on top of cake. Best when freshly made. It should be made like any frosting.

Icing.—The following rules should be observed where boiled icing is not used:

Put the whites of your eggs in a shallow earthern dish, and allow at least a quarter of a pound or sixteen tablespoons of the finest white sugar for each egg. Take part of the sugar at first and sprinkle over the eggs; beat them for about half an hour, stirring in gradually the rest of the sugar; then add the flavor. If you use the juice of a lemon, allow more sugar. Tartaric and lemon-juice whitens icing. It may be shaded a pretty pink with strawberry-juice or cranberry syrup, or colored yellow by putting the juice and rind of a lemon in a thick muslin bag, and squeezing it hard into the egg and sugar.

If cake is well dredged with flour after baking, and then carefully wiped before the icing is put on, it will not run, and can be spread more smoothly. Put frosting on to the cake in large spoonfuls, commencing over the center; then spread it over the cake, using a large knife, dipping it occasionally in cold water. Dry the frosting on the cake in a cool, dry place.

Ice-Cream Icing, for White Cake.—Two cups pulverized white sugar, boiled to a thick syrup; add three teaspoons vanilla; when cold, add the whites of two eggs well beaten, and flavored with two teaspoons of citric acid.

Icing, for Cakes.—Take ten whites of eggs whipped to a stiff froth, with twenty large spoonfuls of orange-flower water. This is to be laid smoothly on the cakes after they are baked. Then return them to the oven for fifteen minutes to harden the icing.

Icing.—One pound pulverized sugar, pour over one tablespoon cold water, beat whites of three eggs a little, not to a stiff froth; add to the sugar and water, put in a deep bowl, place in a vessel of boiling water, and heat. It will become thin and clear, afterward begin to thicken. When it becomes quite thick, remove from the fire and stir while it becomes cool till thick enough to spread with a knife. This will frost several ordinary-sized cakes.

Almond Cake.—Take ten eggs, beaten separately, the yolks from the whites; beat the yolks with half a pound of white sugar; blanch a quarter of a pound of almonds by pouring hot water on them, and remove the skins; pound them in a mortar smooth; add three drops of oil of bitter almonds; and rose-water to prevent the oiling of the almonds. Stir this also into the eggs. Half a pound of sifted flour stirred very slowly into the eggs; lastly, stir in the whites, which must have been whipped to a stiff froth. Pour this into the pans, and bake immediately three-quarters of an hour.

Baked Custards.—Boil a pint of cream with some mace and cinnamon; and when it is cold, take four yolks and two whites of eggs, a little rose and orange-flower water, sack, nutmeg, and sugar to your palate. Mix them well, and bake it in cups.

Or, pour into a deep dish, with or without lining or rim of paste; grate nutmeg and lemon peel over the top, and bake in a slow oven about thirty minutes.

Gooseberry Cream.—Boil them in milk till soft; beat them, and strain the pulp through a coarse sieve. Sweeten cream with sugar to your taste; mix with the pulp; when cold, place in glasses for use.

Imperial Cream.—Boil a quart of cream with the thin rind of a lemon; stir till nearly cold; have ready in a dish to serve in, the juice of three lemons strained with as much sugar as will sweeten the cream; pour it into the dish from a large tea-pot, holding it high, and moving it about to mix with the juice. It should be made from 6 to 12 hours before it is served.

Jumballs.—Flour, 1 lb.; sugar, 1 lb.; make into a light paste with whites of eggs beaten fine; add 1/2 pint of cream; 1/2 lb. of butter, melted; and 1 lb. of blanched almonds, well beaten; knead all together, with a little rose-water; cut into any form; bake in a slow oven. A little butter may be melted with a spoonful of white wine and throw fine sugar over the dish.

Lemon Puffs.—Beat and sift 1 pound of refined sugar; put into a bowl with the juice of two lemons, and mix them together; beat the white of an egg to a high froth; put it into the bowl; put in 3 eggs with two rinds of lemon grated; mix it well up, and throw sugar on the buttered papers; drop on the puffs in small drops, and bake them in a moderately heated oven.

Lemon Tarts.—Pare the rinds of four lemons, and boil tender in two waters, and beat fine. Add to it 4 ounces of blanched almonds, cut thin, 4 ozs. of lump sugar, the juice of the lemons, and a little grated peel. Simmer to a syrup. When cold, turn into a shallow tin tart dish, lined with a rich thin puff paste, and lay bars of the same over, and bake carefully.

Macaroons.—Blanch 4 ozs. of almonds, and pound with 4 spoonfuls of orange-flower water; whisk the whites of four eggs to a froth, then mix it, and 1 lb. of sugar, sifted with the almonds to a paste; and laying a sheet of wafer-paper on a tin, put it on in different little cakes, the shape of macaroons.

Oatmeal Custard.—Take two teaspoons of the finest Scotch oatmeal, beat it up into a sufficiency of cold water in a basin to allow it to run freely. Add to it the yoke of a fresh egg, well worked up; have a pint of scalding new milk on the fire, and pour the oatmeal mixture into it, stirring it round with a spoon so as to incorporate the whole. Add sugar to your taste, and throw in a glass of sherry to the mixture, with a little grated nutmeg. Pour it into a basin, and take it warm in bed. It will be found very grateful and soothing in cases of colds or chills. Some, persons scald a little cinnamon in the milk they use for the occasion.

Orange Crumpets.—Cream, 1 pint; new milk, 1 pint; warm it, and put in it a little rennet or citric acid; when broken, stir it gently; lay it on a cloth to drain all night, and then take the rinds of three oranges, boiled, as for preserving, in three different waters; pound them very fine, and mix them with the curd, and eight eggs in a mortar, a little nutmeg, the juice of a lemon or orange, and sugar to your taste; bake them in buttered tin pans. When baked put a little wine and sugar over them.

Orange Custards.—Boil the rind of half a Seville orange very tender; beat it very fine in a mortar; add a spoonful of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville orange, 4 ozs. loaf sugar, and the yolks of four eggs; beat all together ten minutes; then pour in gradually a pint of boiling cream; keep beating them until they are cold; put them into custard cups, and set them in an earthen dish of hot water; let them stand until they are set, take out, and stick preserved oranges on the top, and serve them hot or cold.

Pommes Au Riz.—Peel a number of apples of a good sort, take out the cores, and let them simmer in a syrup of clarified sugar, with a little lemon peel. Wash and pick some rice, and cook it in milk, moistening it therewith little by little, so that the grains may remain whole. Sweeten it to taste; add a little salt and a taste of lemon-peel. Spread the rice upon a dish, mixing some apple preserve with it, and place the apples upon it, and fill up the vacancies between the apples with some of the rice. Place the dish in the oven until the surface gets brown, and garnish with spoonfuls of bright colored preserve or jelly.

Raspberry Cream.—Mash the fruit gently, and let it drain; then sprinkle a little sugar over, and that will produce more juice; put it through a hair sieve to take out the seeds; then put the juice to some cream, and sweeten it; after which, if you choose to lower it with some milk, it will not curdle; which it would if put to the milk before the cream; but it is best made of raspberry jelly, instead of jam, when the fresh fruit cannot be obtained.

Rice Fritters.—One pint of cooked rice, half cup of sweet milk, two eggs, a tablespoon of flour, and a little salt. Have the lard hot in the skillet, allow a tablespoon to each fritter, fry brown on each side, then turn same as griddle cakes. If you find the rice spatters in the fat, add a very little more flour. You can judge after frying one.

Rice Croquettes.—Make little balls or oblong rolls of cooked rice; season with salt, and pepper if you like; dip in egg; fry in hot lard.

Rice Custards.—Boil 3 pints of new milk with a bit of lemon-peel, cinnamon, and three bay leaves; sweeten; then mix a large spoonful of rice flour into a cup of cold milk, very smooth; mix it with the yolks of four eggs well beaten. Take a basin of the boiling milk, and mix with the cold that has the rice in it; add the remainder of the boiling milk; stir it one way till it boils; pour immediately into a pan; stir till cool, and add a spoonful of brandy, or orange-flower water.

Rice Flummery.—Boil with a pint of new milk, a bit of lemon-peel, and cinnamon; mix with a little cold milk, as much rice flour as will make the whole of a good consistence, sweeten and add a spoonful of peach-water, or a bitter almond beaten; boil it, observing it does not burn; pour it into a shape or a pint basin, taken out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or custard round; or put a teacupful of cream into half a pint of new milk, a glass of white wine, half a lemon squeezed, and sugar.

Rock Cream.—Boil a teacupful of rice till quite soft in new milk and then sweeten it with sugar, and pile it on a dish, lay on it current jelly or preserved fruit, beat up the whites of five eggs with a little powdered sugar and flour, add to this when beaten very stiff about a tablespoon of rich cream and drop it over the rice.

Strawberry and Apple Souffle.—Stew the apple with a little lemon-peel; sweeten them, then lay them pretty high round the inside of a dish. Make a custard of the yolks of two eggs, a little cinnamon, sugar and milk. Let it thicken over a slow fire, but not boil; when ready, pour it in the inside of the apple. Beat the whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and cover the whole. Throw over it a good deal of pounded sugar, and brown it to a fine brown. Any fruit made of a proper consistence does for the walls, strawberries, when ripe, are delicious.

Strawberry Short-Cake.—First prepare the berries by picking; after they have been well washed—the best way to wash them is to hold the boxes under the faucet and let a gentle stream of water run over and through them, then drain, and pick them into an earthen bowl; now take the potato-masher and bruise them and cover with a thick layer of white sugar; now set them aside till the cake is made. Take a quart of sifted flour; half a cup of sweet butter; one egg, well beaten; three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, and milk enough to make a rather stiff dough; knead well, and roll with a rolling-pin till about one inch thick; bake till a nice brown, and when done, remove it to the table; turn it out of the pan; with a light, sharp knife, cut it down lengthwise and crossways; now run the knife through it, and lay it open for a few moments, just to let the steam escape (the steam ruins the color of the berries); then set the bottom crust on the platter; cover thickly with the berries, an inch and a half deep; lay the top crust on the fruit; dust thickly with powdered sugar, and if any berry juice is left in the bowl, pour it round the cake, not over it, and you will have a delicious short-cake.

Snow Cream.—To a quart of cream add the whites of three eggs, cut to a stiff froth, add four spoonfuls of sweet wine, sugar to taste, flavor with essence of lemon. Whip all to a froth, and as soon as it forms take it off and serve in glasses.

Stewed Figs.—Take four ounces of fine sugar, the thin rind of a large lemon, and a pint of cold water, when the sugar is dissolved, add one pound turkey figs, and place the stew-pan over a moderate fire where they may heat and swell slowly, and stew gently for two hours, when they are quite tender, add the juice of one lemon, arrange them in a glass dish and serve cold.

Spanish Cream.—Dissolve in 1/2 pint of rose-water, 1 oz. of isinglass cut small; run it through a hair sieve; add the yolks of three or four eggs, beaten and mixed with half a pint of cream, and two sorrel leaves. Pour it into a deep dish, sweeten with loaf sugar powdered. Stir it till cold, and put it into molds. Lay rings round in different colored sweetmeats. Add, if you like, a little sherry, and a lump or two of sugar, rubbed well upon the rind of a lemon to extract the flavor.

Whipped Cream.—To one quart of good cream, put a few drops of bergamot water, a little orange-flower water, and 1/2 lb. of sugar. When it is dissolved, whip the cream to a froth, and take it up with a skimmer; drain on a sieve, and if for icing, let it settle half an hour before you put it into cups or glasses. Use that which drops into the dish under the sieve, to make it froth the better, adding two whites of eggs. Colored powdered sugar may, if you like, be sprinkled on the top of each.

Asparagus Omelet.—Boil a dozen of the largest and finest asparagus heads you can pick; cut off all the green portion, and chop it in thin slices; season with a small teaspoonful of salt, and about one-fourth of that quantity of soluble cayenne. Then beat up six eggs in a sufficient quantity of new milk to make a stiffish batter. Melt in the frying-pan a quarter of a pound of good, clean dripping, and just before you pour on the batter place a small piece of butter in the center of the pan. When the dripping is quite hot, pour on half your batter, and as it begins to set, place on it the asparagus tops, and cover over with the remainder. This omelet is generally served on a round of buttered toast, with the crusts removed. The batter is richer if made of cream.

Buttered Eggs.—Beat four or five eggs, yolks and whites together, put a quarter of a pound of butter in a basin, and then put that in boiling water, stir it till then pour the butter and the eggs into a sauce-pan; keep a basin in your hand, just hold the sauce-pan in the other over a slow part of the fire, shaking it one way, as it begins to warm; pour it into a basin, and back, then hold it again over the fire, stirring it constantly in the saucepan, and pouring it into the basin, more perfectly to mix the egg and butter until they shall be hot without boiling.

Serve on toasted bread; or in a basin, to eat with salt fish, or red herrings.

Corn-Oysters.—Take a half dozen ears of sweet corn (those which are not too old); with a sharp knife split each row of the corn in the center of the kernel lengthwise; scrape out all the pulp; add one egg, well beaten, a little salt, one tablespoonful of sweet milk; flour enough to make a pretty stiff batter. Drop in hot lard, and fry a delicate brown. If the corn is quite young, omit the milk, using as little flour as possible.

Cheese Omelet.—Mix to a smooth batter three tablespoonfuls of fine flour, with half a pint of milk. Beat up well the yolks and whites of four eggs, a little salt, and a quarter of a pound of grated old English cheese. Add these to the flour and milk, and whisk all the ingredients together for half an hour. Put three ounces of butter into a frying-pan, and when it is boiling pour in the above mixture, fry it for a few minutes, and then turn it carefully; when it is sufficiently cooked on the other side, turn it on to a hot dish and serve.

Irish Stew.—Take a loin of mutton, cut it into chops, season it with a very little pepper and salt, put it into a saucepan, just cover it with water, and let it cook half an hour. Boil two dozen of potatoes, peel and mash them, and stir in a cup of cream while they are hot; then line a deep dish with the potatoes, and lay in the cooked mutton chops, and cover them over with the rest of the potatoes; then set it in the oven to bake. Make some gravy of the broth in which the chops were cooked. This is a very nice dish.

Irish Stew.—Cut off the fat of part of a loin of mutton, and cut it into chops. Pare, wash, and slice very thin some potatoes, two onions, and two small carrots; season with pepper and salt. Cover with water in a stew-pan, and stew gently till the meat is tender, and the potatoes are dissolved in the gravy. It may be made of beef-steaks, or mutton and beef mixed.

Macaroni, Dressed Sweet.—Boil 2 ozs. in a pint of milk, with a bit of lemon peel, and a good bit of cinnamon, till the pipes are swelled to their utmost size without breaking. Lay them on a custard-dish, and pour a custard over them hot. Serve cold.

Macaroni, as Usually Served.—Boil it in milk, or a weak veal broth, flavored with salt. When tender, put it into a dish without the liquor, with bits of butter and grated cheese, and over the top grate more, and put a little more butter. Put the dish into a Dutch oven, a quarter of an hour, and do not let the top become hard.

Omelet.—Six eggs beaten separately, beaten hard, two teaspoons of corn starch, two tablespoons milk, whites of eggs, put in slow at last. Fry in butter.

Rumbled Eggs.—This is very convenient for invalids, or a light dish for supper. Beat up three eggs with two ounces of fresh butter, or well-washed salt butter; add a teaspoonful of cream or new milk. Put all in a saucepan and keep stirring it over the fire for nearly five minutes, until it rises up like scuffle, when it should be immediately dished on buttered toast.

Poached Eggs.—Break an egg into a cup, and put it gently into boiling water; and when the white looks quite set, which will be in about three or four minutes, take it up with an egg slice, and lay it on toast and butter, or spinach. Serve them hot; if fresh laid, they will poach well, without breaking.

Savory Potato-Cakes.—Quarter of a pound of grated ham, one pound of mashed potatoes, and a little suet, mixed with the yolks of two eggs, pepper, salt and nutmeg. Roll it into little balls, or cakes, and fry it a light brown. Sweet herbs may be used in place of ham. Plain potato cakes are made with potatoes and eggs only.

Tomato Toast.—Remove the stem and all the seeds from the tomatoes; they must be ripe, mind, not over ripe; stew them to a pulp, season with butter, pepper and salt; toast some bread (not new bread), butter it, and then spread the tomato on each side, and send it up to table, two slices on each dish, the slices cut in two; and the person who helps it must serve with two half-slices, not attempt to lift the top slice, otherwise the appearance of the under slice will be destroyed.

The pint (/ˈpaɪnt/, listen (help·info); symbol pt,[1][2] sometimes abbreviated as p[3]) is a unit of volume or capacity in both the imperial and United States customary measurement systems. In both of those systems it is traditionally one eighth of a gallon. The British imperial pint is about 20% larger than the American pint because the two systems are defined differently. Almost all other countries have standardized on the metric system, so although some of them still also have traditional units called pints (such as for beverages), the volume varies by regional custom.

The imperial pint (≈ 568 mL) is used in the United Kingdom and Ireland and to a limited extent in Commonwealth nations. In the United States, two kinds of pint are used: a liquid pint (≈ 473 mL) and a less-common dry pint (≈ 551 mL). Other former British colonies, such as Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, converted to the metric system in the 1960s and 1970s; so while the term pint may still be in common use in these countries, it may no longer refer to the British imperial pint once used throughout the British Empire.

Since the majority of countries in the world no longer use American or British imperial units, and most are non-English speaking, a "pint of beer" served in a tavern outside the United Kingdom and the United States may be measured by other standards. In Commonwealth countries it may be a British imperial pint of 568 mL, in countries serving large numbers of American tourists it might be a US liquid pint of 473 mL, in many metric countries it is a half-litre of 500 mL, in some places it is another measure reflecting national and local laws and customs.[4]

Name
Further information: pint
Pint comes from the Old French word pinte and perhaps ultimately from Vulgar Latin pincta meaning "painted", for marks painted on the side of a container to show capacity.[5] It is linguistically related, though greatly diverging in meaning, to Pinto – an Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese name for a person with a speckled or dark complexion, often used as a surname in these languages.

The United States dry pint is equal to one eighth of a United States dry gallon. It is used in the United States, but is not as common as the liquid pint.

A now-obsolete unit of measurement in Scotland, known as the Scottish pint, or joug, is equal to 1696 mL (2 pints 19.69 imp fl oz). It remained in use until the 19th century, surviving significantly longer than most of the old Scottish measurements.

The word pint is one of numerous false friends between English and French. They are not the same unit although they have the same linguistic origin. The French word pinte is etymologically related, but historically described a larger unit. The Royal pint (pinte du roi) was 48 French cubic inches (952.1 mL),[7] but regional pints varied in size depending on locality and on commodity (usually wine or olive oil) varying from 0.95 L to over 2 L.[7]

In Canada, the Weights and Measures Act (R.S. 1985) defines a pint in English as one eighth of a gallon, but defines a pinte in French as one quarter of a gallon.[8] Thus, if "a pint of beer" is ordered in English, servers are legally required to serve an imperial pint (568 mL) of beer,[9] but if "une pinte de bière" is ordered in French, it is legally required to serve an imperial quart (une pinte), which is 1136 mL, or twice as much.[10] To order an imperial pint when speaking French in Canada, one must instead order une chopine de bière.[11]

In Flanders, the word pintje, meaning 'little pint', refers only to a 250 mL glass of lager. Some West- and East-Flemish dialects use it as a word for beaker. The equivalent word in German, Pintchen, refers to a glass of a third of a litre in Cologne and the Rhineland.

In South Australia, ordering "a pint of beer" results in 425 mL (15 fl oz) being served. Customers must specifically request "an Imperial pint of beer" to get 570 mL (20 fl oz). Australians from other states often contest the size of their beers in Adelaide.[12]

Equivalence
One US liquid pint of water weighs 1.04318 pounds (16.6909 oz), which gives rise to a popular saying: "A pint's a pound, the world around".[13]

However, the statement does not hold around the world because the British imperial pint, which was also the standard measure in Australia, India, Malaya, New Zealand, South Africa and other former British colonies, weighs 1.2528 pounds (20.0448 oz), giving rise to the origin of a popular[citation needed] saying used in Commonwealth countries: "a pint of pure water weighs a pound and a quarter".[14]

History
The pint is traditionally one eighth of a gallon. In the Latin of the apothecaries' system, the symbol O (octavius or octarius; plural octavii or octarii – reflecting the "eighth" concept in its octa- syllable) was used for the pint.[15] Because of the variety of definitions of a gallon, there have been equally many versions of the pint.

Britain's North American colonies adopted the British wine gallon, defined in 1707 as 231 cubic inches exactly (3 in × 7 in × 11 in) as their basic liquid measure, from which the US wet pint is derived; and the British corn gallon (1⁄8 of a standard "Winchester" bushel of corn, or 268.8 cubic inches) as its dry measure, from which the US dry pint is derived.

In 1824, the British parliament replaced all the various gallons with a new imperial gallon based on ten pounds of distilled water at 62 °F (16.667 °C) (277.42 cubic inches), from which the current UK pint is derived.

The various Canadian provinces continued to use the Queen Anne Winchester wine gallon as a basis for their pint until 1873, well after Britain adopted the imperial system in 1824. This made the Canadian pint compatible with the American pint, but after 1824 it was incompatible with the British pint. The traditional French pinte used in Lower Canada (Quebec) was twice the size of the traditional English "pint" used in Upper Canada (Ontario). After four of the British provinces united in the Canadian Confederation in 1867, Canada legally adopted the British imperial system of measure in 1873, making Canadian liquid units incompatible with American ones from that year forward.[16] In 1873, the French Canadian pinte was defined as being one imperial quart or two imperial pints, while the imperial pint was legally called a chopine in French Canada. Canadian imperial units of liquid measure remain incompatible with American traditional units to this day, and although the Canadian pint, quart, and gallon are still legal units of measure in Canada, they are still 20% larger than the American ones.

Historically, units called a pint (or the equivalent in the local language) were used across much of Europe, with values varying between countries from less than half a litre to over one litre. Within continental Europe, these pints were replaced with liquid measures based on the metric system during the 19th century. The term is still in limited use in parts of France, where une pinte means an imperial quart, which is 2 imperial pints, whereas a pint is une chopine—and Central Europe, notably some areas of Germany[17] and Switzerland, where ein Schoppen is colloquially used for roughly half a litre. In Spanish holiday resorts frequented by British tourists, 'pint' is often taken to mean a beer glass (especially a dimple mug). Half-pint 285 mL, and pint mugs , 570 mL, may therefore be referred to as media jarra ('half jar/jug') and jarra (grande) ('large jar/jug').[citation needed]

Effects of metrication

Pints are commonly used for the sale of milk in the United Kingdom. The label gives both the metric and the imperial volume.
In the British and Irish metrication processes, the pint was replaced by metric units as the legally defined primary unit of measure for trading by volume or capacity, except for the sale of draught beer and cider, and milk in returnable containers.[18][19] As a supplementary unit, the pint can still be used in those countries in all circumstances. UK legislation mandates that draught beer and cider must be sold in a third of a pint, two thirds of a pint or multiples of half a pint, which must be served in stamped, measured glasses or from government-stamped meters. Milk, in returnable containers may come in pints without the metric equivalent stated. However all other goods apart from the aforementioned exceptions must be sold or labelled in metric units. Milk in plastic containers mostly comes multiples of 1 pint sizes, but are required to display the metric equivalent on packaging.[20] Filtered milk, and UHT Milk sold in the UK is commonly sold in multiples of 1 litre bottles or containers. [21] Recipes published in the UK and Ireland would have given ingredient quantities in imperial, where the pint is used as a unit for larger liquid quantities, as well as the metric measure - though recipes written now are more likely to use metric units.[22][23]

In Australia and New Zealand, a subtle change was made to 1 pint milk bottles during the conversion from imperial to metric in the 1970s. The height and diameter of the milk bottle remained unchanged, so that existing equipment for handling and storing the bottles was unaffected, but the shape was adjusted to increase the capacity from 568 mL to 600 mL—a conveniently rounded metric measure. Such milk bottles are no longer officially referred to as pints. However, the "pint glass" in pubs in Australia remains closer to the standard imperial pint, at 570 mL. It holds about 500 mL of beer and about 70 mL of froth, except in South Australia, where a pint is served in a 425 mL glass and a 570 mL glass is called an "imperial pint". In New Zealand, there is no longer any legal requirement for beer to be served in standard measures: in pubs, the largest size of glass, which is referred to as a pint, varies, but usually contains 425 mL.[24]

After metrication in Canada, milk and other liquids in pre-packaged containers came in metric sizes so conversion issues could no longer arise. Draft beer in Canada, when advertised as a "pint", is legally required to be an imperial pint (568 mL).[25][26][27] With the allowed margin of error of 0.5 fluid ounces, a "pint" that is less than 554 mL of beer is an offence, though this regulation is often violated and rarely enforced.[28] To avoid legal issues, many drinking establishments are moving away from using the term "pint" and are selling "glasses" or "sleeves" of beer, neither of which have a legal definition.[29]

A 375 mL bottle of liquor in the US and the Canadian maritime provinces is sometimes referred to as a "pint" and a 200 mL bottle is called a "half-pint", harking back to the days when liquor came in US pints, fifths, quarts, and half-gallons.[30] Liquor in the US has been sold in metric-sized bottles since 1980 although beer is still sold in US traditional units.[31]

In France, a standard 250 mL measure of beer is known as un demi ("a half"), originally meaning a half-pint.

Notes
 After the 1985 (UK), c. 1964 (Canada), redefinition of the imperial gallon
 Fifty imperial pints, or sixty US liquid pints, are both very close to one cubic foot
 After the 1964 redefinition of the litre and the 1959 redefinition of the inch

The Kerry Health and Nutrition Institute (KHNI) has identified 10 key trends set to shape the food industry in 2023, with women’s health, affordable nutrition and sugar and salt reduction among some of the top areas for innovation.
Today’s consumers are proactively managing their physical and mental wellbeing, and are on the lookout for better-for-you products that not only good for themselves, but also for the planet. Underpinning this in these belt-tightening times is the need for affordable nutrition.

“Sustainability continues to be the leading driver in food and beverage innovation, as consumers become increasingly focused on health and affordability in their nutritional spend,” said Nathan Pratt, senior nutrition scientist at Kerry.

Leveraging developments in research, technology and product development, KHNI’s global network of researchers analysed the trends expected to drive consumer behaviour this year and the opportunities they present for product developers.

“The Kerry Health and Nutrition Institute’s research finds 2023 will see long-standing trends of health and sustainability take more personalised approach to specific consumer groups and need-states,” added Pratt.

“Nutritional innovation is increasingly enabling consumers to proactively manage their physical and mental health through functional beverages, sex-specific nutrition and probiotics for more than digestive health.

“We are also seeing consumers placing increased importance on the nutritional density of their foods, as they seek affordable yet healthy alternatives in today’s macroenvironment.

“The industry must consider all of these trends in the context of feeding a growing global population – a task to which food science and technology will be critically important in the coming year and beyond.”

Top 10 trends for 2023
Crackdown on sugar and salt

Changes in nutrition and labelling legislation are becoming more widespread, and consumers are becoming more health conscience.

Front-of-pack signposting is increasing to make healthier choices simpler but is also driving the increasing need for innovative technology to help manufacturers create healthier, more sustainable products that deliver on taste and experience.

Takeaway:

National governments are becoming less forgiving to the food industry, propelling efforts to nutritionally improve foods and beverages.

Consumers are becoming more health conscious, resulting in an increase in front of pack signposting.

Differing front of pack labelling and marketing restrictions across countries will make it more difficult for companies to sell products across several countries.

Decreasing nutrients of concern like sodium, sugar, and saturated fat while maintaining taste and shelf life will be the major challenges introduced by these global initiatives.

Keeping costs in check
With inflation at 40-year high, affordable nutrition has never been more critical.

According to Kerry’s experts, food innovation is not only about premium novel ingredients, but must also focus on how producers can make the food system more economically sustainable by maximising the nutritional density and affordability of foods and snacks.

Takeaway:

Taste and sensory knowledge are a hidden opportunity – a broad knowledge of masking different protein types can allow flexibility in raw material sourcing as cost fluctuates.

Whole grains, egg, dairy, fruits and vegetables are nutritionally dense and can be the best sources of nutrition per dollar. Beans are a great example of an inexpensive food that provides fibre, protein, minerals and calories.

Plant-based to plant-forward
Consumers are increasingly looking beyond meat mimicry to plant-forward products as they challenge the heavily processed nature of plant proteins.

Plant-forward innovations that offer servings of fruits, vegetables or whole grains can help bridge gaps in the consumer’s day-to-day diet, while differentiating themselves in the plant-based market.

Protein production’s future

It will be nearly impossible to feed the planet’s population growth using our current systems of food production – with an expected global popular of 10 billion by 2050.

Food science and technology will be critically important to innovate alternative means of producing the protein required to feed the planet.

Women’s health
A broad scope of clinical research is increasingly addressing women’s health issues though nutrition, ranging from digestive, heart and cognitive health to specific needs such as fertility, breastfeeding and menopause.

Although women are at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies than men at certain stages – leading to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, strokes and cancer – much of the research on these diseases to date has been conducted on men.

Takeaway:

Expect to see this trend accelerate in the near future with increased clinical research into female-specific conditions and the growing capabilities of precision nutrition.

Certain plant-based botanicals have potential to support female specific conditions – for example, licorice root extract has a similar structure to estrogen and is popular in dietary supplements to alleviate menopausal symptoms. The evidence base for these botanicals is growing.

Beyond digestive health
Kerry microbiome

Microbes extend far beyond the gut or digestive tract, and microbiologists are identifying more bacteria with interesting properties.

The microbiome has been also linked to reproductive and cardiometabolic health, alongside immunity. As advances in molecular research continue, it is of tremendous importance that associated probiotic products deliver the benefits they are claimed to.

Advanced activity
Joint health and cardiovascular health are not just for healthy ageing anymore – expect to see more products with these benefits targeting all active age groups.

Gym-goers are looking to enhance the function of their joints, heart and vascular system to allow more mobility, more effective workouts and reduce risk of injury.

Reducing inflammation is a key way ingredients can help support these areas of health.

Cognitive health
There is an increased focus on mental wellbeing post-Covid. A growing body of science on the role of ingredients such as adaptogens and nootropics in brain health is seeing cognitive health carve a strong foothold in the F&B space.

Expect to see this trend fragment in the future – we’ve moved beyond ‘energy’and having one product fit that need – typically coffee – into very specific aspects of cognition like focus, attention, short-term or working memory and so forth.

Think about dayparts when choosing a type of cognitive health benefit, for example, focus for morning, stress for afternoon, relaxation for evening.

Hydration optimised
Hydration is moving beyond plain water as consumers look for more exciting options such as sparkling water or electrolyte powers.

There is also a move away from sweetness, and sparkling waters and low-sweetness options are being chosen more commonly by consumers looking to hydrate and manage weight.

Functionality flourishing
Kerry functional beverages

Functional beverages, too, are leading an industry-wide boom in products aimed to help consumers proactively manage their health.

Takeaway:

Consumers are focusing more on short-term need states – beauty, immune support, digestive health, energy and weight management are among the top 5 desired health benefits globally.

Balancing consumer perception with science is important – ingredients should resonate with consumer beliefs about health but also be shown to have a demonstrated health benefit in scientific studies.

Specificity is important – consumers are looking for specific health benefits from specific types of products at specific times of the day, and these vary by age group. It’s essential to understand the specific consumer target when developing products.

Ingredients
Pastry for double-crust pie (9 inches)
4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
Directions
On a lightly floured surface, roll one half of pie dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Trim pastry even with rim; flute edge. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Leave remaining pie dough refrigerated.
Preheat oven to 400°. Combine blueberries, sugar, tapioca, lemon juice and salt; toss gently. Let stand for 15 minutes.
Add filling to pie pastry; dot with butter. Bake 20 minutes on a lower oven rack. Reduce heat to 350°; bake 10 minutes more. Cover edges loosely with foil to prevent burning. Return to lower rack of oven; bake 15-20 minutes longer, until blueberries are bubbly and beginning to burst. Cool on a wire rack.
Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Cut out stars using different-sized cookie cutters as desired. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350° until golden brown, 5-10 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool. Place stars over cooled pie in any pattern desired.

Test Kitchen Tips
Time-saving tip: Bake star cutouts a day in advance.
For a filling that's ultra smooth, finely grind tapioca in a food processor before stirring it in.
Don't skip the 30-minute resting time before baking: It helps your fluting stay defined.
Pastry for double-crust pie (9 inches): Combine 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/2 tsp. salt; cut in 1 cup cold butter until crumbly. Gradually add 1/3 to 2/3 cup ice water, tossing with a fork until dough holds together when pressed. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a disk; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 1 hour or overnight.

Creamy Mac and Cheese Tips
Can you use different kinds of cheese to make creamy mac and cheese?
If you love cheesy recipes, this creamy mac and cheese might become a new favorite. The Velveeta keeps it really creamy, rich and smooth while the cheddar adds that classic mac and cheese flavor. If you're going to swap out a cheese in this recipe, it would be best to leave the Velveeta and experiment with the shredded cheese stirred in at the end. Instead of cheddar, try another cheese that melts easily like Gruyere, Gouda, Monterey Jack, Havarti or Muenster. Here are more Velveeta recipes if you can't get enough!
What else can you add to creamy mac and cheese?
Many mix-ins go well with mac and cheese. You can add steamed vegetables such as broccoli or cauliflower, or make your homemade creamy mac and cheese a hearty main dish by adding cubed ham, rotisserie chicken, ground beef or pulled pork. Add texture by topping it with green onions, parsley, bacon, truffle oil, crushed crackers or potato chips.
How can you add a bread crumb topping to creamy mac and cheese?
It's not uncommon for casserole recipes to be topped off with a crunchy, buttery topping like buttered bread crumbs or crackers. If you crave the extra crunch, buttered bread crumbs can be added to this creamy mac and cheese. Combine 3/4 cup dry bread crumbs with 3 tablespoons melted butter. Sprinkle over the top of the mac and cheese before baking.
How do you keep mac and cheese creamy?
This homemade mac and cheese recipe has plenty of creamy ingredients, and you can make sure to keep all of that creamy goodness by not overcooking your cream sauce. Cook it just until thickened. Once it's ready, seal in moisture by covering your dish with foil for the first half of the bake.
Can you make creamy mac and cheese ahead of time?
For the very best texture (not too creamy, not too dry), it's best to make this mac and cheese fresh. But, if you're pressed for time, you can make it ahead. To account for some of the liquid being absorbed by the pasta while it waits to be baked, cook the macaroni just to al dente and add more milk than the recipe calls for. You'll want the mixture to be looser than if you were baking it right away. Stir in 2 to 2-1/2 cups milk.


Ingredients
1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened
1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup Key lime juice or lime juice
1 graham cracker crust (9 inches)
2 cups whipped topping
Lime slices, optional
Directions
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Beat in milk and lime juice until blended. Transfer to crust. Refrigerate, covered, at least 4 hours. Just before serving, garnish with whipped topping and, if desired, lime slices.

Ingredients
18 Oreo cookies
Oil for deep-fat frying
1 cup biscuit/baking mix
1 large egg
1/2 cup 2% milk
Confectioners' sugar
Directions
On each of eighteen 4-in. wooden skewers, thread 1 cookie, inserting pointed end of skewer into filling. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.
In a deep cast-iron skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 375°. Place biscuit mix in a shallow bowl. In another bowl, combine egg and milk; whisk into biscuit mix just until moistened.
Holding skewer, dip cookie into biscuit mixture to coat both sides; shake off excess.
Fry cookies, a few at a time, until golden brown, 1-2 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.

Ingredients
1/4 pound bulk pork sausage
2 tablespoons butter
2 to 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1-1/4 to 1-1/3 cups whole milk
Warm biscuits
Directions
In a small skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink, 3-5 minutes, breaking it into crumbles; drain. Add butter and heat until melted. Add the flour, salt and pepper; cook and stir until blended. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve with biscuits.
Biscuits and Sausage Gravy Tips
What can I add to sausage gravy?
To add more flavor to your gravy, consider stirring in some fresh herbs like chopped thyme or parsley (learn how to grow fresh herbs!).
How can I thicken gravy without flour?
Cornstarch and arrowroot are gluten-free thickening agents you can try. They’ll also keep your sauce clear and cloud-free. You’ll need about 1 tablespoon for every cup of liquid in the recipe. To use, mix the agent with equal parts water to create a slurry and pour it into the pot. Whisk continuously over high heat until the agent is well incorporated and the sauce starts to thicken.
Can I reheat sausage gravy?
Yes, you can reheat sausage gravy. The trick to reheating gravy is to start it at a low temperature, and then whisk vigorously once it comes to a boil to mix the ingredients back together.
Can I make this recipe without milk?
You can make this breakfast recipe without milk. Try substituting the whole milk with heavy cream or skim milk. Do keep in mind that using a milk alternative may thin out your gravy.

Ingredients
1 large egg, beaten
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
